# Twilio Transformation dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_twilio/))
# 📣 What does this dbt package do?

- Produces modeled tables that leverage Twilio data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/twilio) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/twilio#schemainformation) and builds off the output of our [Twilio source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twilio_source).

The following table provides a detailed list of all models materialized within this package by default. 
> TIP: See more details about these models in the package's [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_twilio/#!/overview?g_v=1).

| **Model**                          | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?

## Step 1: Prerequisites
To use this dbt package, you must have the following:

- At least one Fivetran Twilio connector syncing data into your destination.
- A **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Databricks** destination.

### Databricks Dispatch Configuration
If you are using a Databricks destination with this package you will need to add the below (or a variation of the below) dispatch configuration within your `dbt_project.yml`. This is required in order for the package to accurately search for macros within the `dbt-labs/spark_utils` then the `dbt-labs/dbt_utils` packages respectively.
```yml
dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```

## Step 2: Install the package
Include the following Twilio package version in your `packages.yml` file:
> TIP: Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/twilio
    version: [">=0.2.0", "<0.3.0"]
```
## Step 3: Define database and schema variables
By default, this package runs using your destination and the `Twilio` schema. If this is not where your Twilio data is (for example, if your Twilio schema is named `twilio_fivetran`), add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
vars:
  twilio_database: your_database_name
  twilio_schema: your_schema_name
```

## Step 4: Enabling/Disabling Models

Your Twilio connector might not sync every table that this package expects, for example if you are not using the Twilio messaging service feature. If your syncs exclude certain tables, it is either because you do not use that functionality in Twilio or have actively excluded some tables from your syncs. In order to enable or disable the relevant tables in the package, you will need to add the following variable(s) to your `dbt_project.yml` file.

By default, all variables are assumed to be `true`.

```yml
vars:
  using_twilio_call: False # Disable this if not using call
  using_twilio_messaging_service: False # Disable this if not using messaging_service
```

## (Optional) Step 5: Additional configurations

<details open><summary>Expand/Collapse configurations</summary>

### Changing the Build Schema

By default, this package will build the Twilio final models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_twilio`), intermediate models in (`<target_schema>` + `_int_twilio`), and staging models within a schema titled (`<target_schema>` + `_stg_twilio`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your modeled Twilio data to be written to, add the following configuration to your `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
models:
  twilio:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
    intermediate:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
  twilio_source:
    +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```

> Note that if your profile does not have permissions to create schemas in your warehouse, you can set each `+schema` to blank. The package will then write all tables to your pre-existing target schema.

### Change the source table references
If an individual source table has a different name than the package expects (but is in the same schema and database as the other tables), add the table name as it appears in your destination to the respective variable:

> IMPORTANT: See this project's [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_twilio/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
vars:
    twilio_<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name 
```
